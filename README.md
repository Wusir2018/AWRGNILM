## Overview
In this paper, we propose Adaptive Recurrence Graph for Appliance classification in NILM. The ADRG  treat  recurrence hyper-parameters  as a learn-able parameters like ordinary neural network weights.




This package contains a Python implementation of Adaptive Recurrence Graph for Appliance classification in NILM. 



## Prerequisites
- python
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tqdm
- torch
- sklearn
- seaborn
- nptdms 

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data for a specific dataset. Note: the data directory provided includes preprocessed data for the two datasets LILAC and PLAID.
2. To replicate experiment results you can run the `run_experiments.py` code in the src directory. 

Feel free to open an issue with any questions.
