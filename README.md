# ADRG_NILM
Adaptive Recurrence Graph for Appliance classification in NILM.

The  performance of  NILM  system  highly  depends  on  the  features  used  to characterize  appliances. 

This package contains a Python implementation of Adaptive Recurrence Graph for Appliance classification in NILM. The ADRG  treat  recurrence hyper-parameters  as a learn-able parameters like ordinary neural network weights.
